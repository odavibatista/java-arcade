# Java Arcade
## 1. Introduction
This is a small Java application that allows you to emulate an arcade.
I've created this on behalf of Oracle Academy's Java Fundamentals Course.

## 2. Features
It's still under development. The application can be run through the Main class, and come with a few lines of code emulating the arcade.
It will be updated with more features in the future, including a graphic interface.
